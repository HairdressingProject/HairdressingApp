Welcome to documentation site for the Hairdress App Project.

# Project Overview
## Hairdressing Project - Admin Portal v2
This is our second (and hopefully last) attempt to build the Admin Portal of our project, mostly focused on the front-end (the back-end code is already finished, including the database).

We will keep it as simple as possible this time, using:

- HTML
- SCSS
- JavaScript
- Zurb Foundation

The previously built back-end uses ASP.NET Core with JWT authentication (works with cookies and Authorization headers) and MySQL (though it also works with MariaDB).
